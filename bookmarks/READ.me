# Running the app 

You need the gulp-cli installed globally: `npm install -g gulp-cli`

Make sure you are using the correct version of node with NVM: run `nvm use` in the root of the repo. 
If you don't have nvm installed, add it: `brew install nvm`.

Install node modules: `npm i`

To run locally: `npm start` or `gulp`.
